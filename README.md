This is another repo I created for Watchpal to hide my TMDB API key. The original repo is now private, but that will be the one getting updates from now on so new watchpal updates will **not** be reflected here. New watchpal updates will no longer be open source. This was a hard choice to make but I feel it is necessary since I plan on added personalised watchpal features which require logging in.

Thanks,
